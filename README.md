## Linear Programming with Excel

<i>The file in this repo contains two separate models I created finding optimal solutions to problems for two different scenarios. I build these models and run sensitivity analyses using Solver in Excel.</i>

### Computer Model

<i> I work for a computer manufacturing company and my task is to help them figure out the optimal quantity of each product they should produce in order for them to attain maximum sales revenue given numerous constraints. (Constraints can be viewed in the Solver interface... Data -> Solver -> Constraints). </i>

### Alloy Model

<i> I work for a metals company. They produce 4 different types of alloys that can derived from three different types of metals (aluminum, copper, magnesium). Each alloy is a different value, and demands a specific ratio of the 3 metals. I am told the supply of the three metals the company has, and asked to find out the optimal alloy production that lead to the maximum revenue.</i>
